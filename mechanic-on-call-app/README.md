# Mechanic On Call App

This project is designed to streamline two main processes for Mechanic of Call.

The first process is to streamline bookings from Mechanic On Call clients. The website should be user friendly and allow clients to tell Mechanic On Call:
- What is wrong with their vehicle
- Where they are located
Client bookings should then be automatically added to Mechanic On Call’s calendar.

The second process is to streamline bookings to Mechanic On Call. A point-of-sale (POS) system that connects bookings to the Mechanic On Call Quickbooks (or some application of similar function)


## Features

- **Serive Booking**: Integrated Caledly booking system into website.
